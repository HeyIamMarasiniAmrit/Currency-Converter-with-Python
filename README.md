# Currency-Converter-with-Python
Python can be used to develop this simple GUI application. This project is about building a currency converter that will allow you to convert currencies from one unit to another, such as converting Indian rupee into pounds or euros.

The design of this application will be straightforward, focusing on the primary function, which is converting currency units. With Tkinter, you can access the Tk GUI toolkit, which comes with Python.

This currency converter project in python requires a basic understanding of python programming and the pygame library.

Tkinter – For UI
requests – to get the URL

In your terminal, type the following code to install the Tkinter and requests libraries:

pip install tkinterpip 
install requests
Here are the steps required for building the Python Project on Currency Converter:

Real-time Exchange rates: We will use: https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/USD to get real-time exchange rates
Import required Libraries: Our Python project uses the Tkinter and requests libraries. We must import the libraries.
CurrencyConverter Class:Afterward, we will create a CurrencyConverter class that gathers real-time exchange rates, converts the currency, and returns the converted amount.
UI for CurrencyConverter: Next step will be to create a user interface for a currency converter.
Lastly create the main function.
